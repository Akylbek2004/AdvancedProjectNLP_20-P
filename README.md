## Project Description

This project is developed as part of the **Advanced Programming (INF395)** course.  
It implements a **review classification system** using **machine learning** techniques.  
The goal is to classify IMDB movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on their content.

The system uses the **Random Forest Classifier** from scikit-learn to train a sentiment analysis model.  
A **Streamlit** web interface is developed to provide user interaction for real-time predictions.

## Problem Statement

The problem you're solving is the classification of movie comments into two categories: positive and negative. This is important for understanding audience sentiment, which can help movie studios, marketing teams, and content creators tailor their strategies based on viewer feedback. By automating sentiment analysis, you can efficiently process large volumes of reviews and gain insights into how well a movie is received by its audience.

## Objectives

To accurately classify movie comments as positive or negative using machine learning models.
To provide a scalable solution for analyzing large volumes of movie reviews.
To generate insights into audience sentiment, helping movie studios and marketers understand public reception.
To enhance user experience by categorizing reviews, making it easier for viewers to navigate through feedback.
